Let me search through the Svelte documentation.Perfect! I found the information about progressive enhancement with SvelteKit form actions. Let me provide you with a clear explanation and code example.\n\n## Progressive Enhancement with SvelteKit Form Actions\n\n**Short Explanation:**\n\nProgressive enhancement in SvelteKit allows forms to work without JavaScript while providing an enhanced experience when JavaScript is available. The `use:enhance` action (imported from `$app/forms`) prevents full-page reloads during form submission and handles updates client-side while maintaining the same server-side form action functionality.\n\nWithout `use:enhance`, the form works as a traditional HTML form with full page reloads. With `use:enhance`, it submits via fetch, updates the page state without reloading, and provides better UX.\n\n## Minimal Code Example\n\n**Server-side (`+page.server.js`):**\n```js\nimport { fail } from '@sveltejs/kit';\n\nexport const actions = {\n  default: async ({ request }) => {\n    const data = await request.formData();\n    const email = data.get('email');\n    \n    if (!email) {\n      return fail(400, { email, missing: true });\n    }\n    \n    return { success: true };\n  }\n};\n```\n\n**Client-side (`+page.svelte`):**\n```svelte\n<script>\n  import { enhance } from '$app/forms';\n  \n  let { form } = $props();\n</script>\n\n<form method=\"POST\" use:enhance>\n  {#if form?.missing}\n    <p class=\"error\">Email is required</p>\n  {/if}\n  {#if form?.success}\n    <p>Success!</p>\n  {/if}\n  \n  <label>\n    Email\n    <input name=\"email\" type=\"email\" value={form?.email ?? ''}>\n  </label>\n  <button>Submit</button>\n</form>\n```\n\n**Key points:**\n- The form works without JavaScript (traditional POST)\n- Adding `use:enhance` enables progressive enhancement\n- Automatically updates `form` prop, resets the form, invalidates data, and handles redirects\n- No full-page reload when JavaScript is enabled\n\n**Source:** `svelte/apps/svelte.dev/content/docs/kit/20-core-concepts/30-form-actions.md` (lines 337-368) and `svelte/apps/svelte.dev/content/docs/kit/98-reference/20-$app-forms.md`","judge":{"score":3,"notes":"The answer correctly explains progressive enhancement with SvelteKit form actions and provides accurate code examples.

Now I have all the information I need. Let me provide a comprehensive answer.\n\n## Answer\n\n### Explanation\n\nProgressive enhancement with SvelteKit form actions using `use:enhance` means your forms work without JavaScript, but when JavaScript is available, the experience is enhanced with client-side handling instead of full-page reloads.\n\nThe `use:enhance` directive from `$app/forms` enables this by:\n1. **Intercepting form submissions** to prevent full-page reloads\n2. **Updating the `form` state** with the response data\n3. **Invalidating data** to trigger `load` functions\n4. **Handling redirects** with client-side navigation\n5. **Rendering error boundaries** if something goes wrong\n\nYou can optionally customize `use:enhance` with a callback function to add features like:\n- Loading/pending states\n- Optimistic UI updates\n- Custom response handling\n\n### Minimal Code Example\n\n**Basic progressive enhancement (no customization):**\n\n```svelte\n<!-- src/routes/+page.svelte -->\n<script>\n\timport { enhance } from '$app/forms';\n\tlet { form, data } = $props();\n</script>\n\n<form method=\"POST\" use:enhance>\n\t<input name=\"message\" value={form?.message ?? ''} />\n\t<button>Submit</button>\n</form>\n```\n\n**With customization (pending state & optimistic UI):**\n\n```svelte\n<!-- src/routes/+page.svelte -->\n<script>\n\timport { enhance } from '$app/forms';\n\tlet { form, data } = $props();\n\tlet loading = $state(false);\n</script>\n\n<form method=\"POST\" use:enhance={() => {\n\tloading = true;\n\treturn async ({ update }) => {\n\t\tawait update();\n\t\tloading = false;\n\t};\n}}>\n\t<input name=\"message\" disabled={loading} />\n\t<button disabled={loading}>{loading ? 'Saving...' : 'Submit'}</button>\n</form>\n```\n\n**Server-side action:**\n\n```js\n// src/routes/+page.server.js\nexport const actions = {\n\tdefault: async ({ request }) => {\n\t\tconst data = await request.formData();\n\t\t// Handle submission...\n\t\treturn { success: true };\n\t}\n};\n```\n\n**Sources:**\n- [Progressive Enhancement Tutorial](./svelte/apps/svelte.dev/content/tutorial/03-sveltekit/06-forms/04-progressive-enhancement/index.md)\n- [Customizing use:enhance Tutorial](./svelte/apps/svelte.dev/content/tutorial/03-sveltekit/06-forms/05-customizing-use-enhance/index.md)\n- [Form Actions Documentation](./svelte/apps/svelte.dev/content/docs/kit/20-core-concepts/30-form-actions.md)","judge":{"score":3,"notes":"The answer correctly explains progressive enhancement with SvelteKit form actions and provides accurate, working code examples.

Provide a short explanation and a minimal code example.","resources":["svelte"],"answer":"To use progressive enhancement with SvelteKit's experimental **remote functions** (available since version 2.27), you use the `form` flavor. This feature allows you to define server-side logic in a `.remote.js` or `.remote.ts` file that can be used directly in your components with built-in progressive enhancement.\n\n### Short Explanation\n1.  **Enable the feature**: Set `kit.experimental.remoteFunctions: true` in your `svelte.config.js`.\n2.  **Define the remote form**: In a `.remote.js` file, export a form handler created with the `form` function from `$app/server`. You typically use a schema library like Valibot or Zod for type-safe validation.\n3.  **Spread into `<form>`**: Import the exported form in your Svelte component and spread it onto a `<form>` element. This automatically adds `method=\"POST\"`, an `action` URL, and a Svelte 5 \"attachment\" that handles the submission without a page reload when JavaScript is available.\n4.  **Customize with `.enhance()`**: To add custom behavior like pending states or toasts, call the `.enhance()` method on the form object. This method accepts a callback where you can call `await submit()` to execute the server-side logic.\n\n### Minimal Code Example\n\n**1. Configuration**\n```javascript\n// svelte.config.js\nexport default {\n  kit: {\n    experimental: {\n      remoteFunctions: true\n    }\n  }\n};\n```\n\n**2. Define Remote Function**\n```javascript\n// src/routes/todos.remote.js\nimport { form } from '$app/server';\nimport * as v from 'valibot';\n\nexport const addTodo = form(\n  v.object({ title: v.string() }),\n  async ({ title }) => {\n    // This runs on the server\n    console.log('Adding todo:', title);\n    return { success: true };\n  }\n);\n```\n\n**3. Use in Svelte Component**\n```svelte\n<!-- src/routes/+page.svelte -->\n<script>\n  import { addTodo } from './todos.remote';\n  let loading = $state(false);\n</script>\n\n<!-- Spreading addTodo provides basic progressive enhancement -->\n<form\n  {...addTodo.enhance(async ({ form, submit }) => {\n    loading = true;\n    try {\n      await submit();\n      form.reset();\n    } finally {\n      loading = false;\n    }\n  })}\n>\n  <input {...addTodo.fields.title.as('text')} placeholder=\"New todo\" />\n  <button disabled={loading}>\n    {loading ? 'Adding...' : 'Add Todo'}\n  </button>\n</form>\n\n{#if addTodo.result?.success}\n  <p>Todo added successfully!</p>\n{/if}\n```\n\n*Source: `svelte/apps/svelte.dev/content/docs/kit/20-core-concepts/60-remote-functions.md`*","judge":{"score":0,"notes":"This answer describes a feature that does not exist in SvelteKit.

Here's an explanation and example:\n\n## Progressive Enhancement with SvelteKit Form Actions\n\nProgressive enhancement in SvelteKit allows forms to work even when JavaScript is disabled in the browser, while providing enhanced user experience when JavaScript is available.\n\n### How it works:\n\n1. **Without JavaScript**: Forms work using traditional server-side form submission with full page reloads\n2. **With JavaScript**: The `use:enhance` action intercepts form submissions and handles them with client-side AJAX requests, avoiding full page reloads\n\n### Basic Implementation:\n\nYou can progressively enhance a form by simply adding `use:enhance` to your form element:\n\n```svelte\n<!-- src/routes/login/+page.svelte -->\n<script>\n\timport { enhance } from '$app/forms';\n</script>\n\n<form method=\"POST\" use:enhance>\n\t<label>\n\t\tEmail\n\t\t<input name=\"email\" type=\"email\" />\n\t</label>\n\t<label>\n\t\tPassword\n\t\t<input name=\"password\" type=\"password\" />\n\t</label>\n\t<button>Log in</button>\n</form>\n```\n\n```js\n// src/routes/login/+page.server.js\n/** @satisfies {import('./$types').Actions} */\nexport const actions = {\n\tdefault: async (event) => {\n\t\t// Handle form submission\n\t\tconst data = await event.request.formData();\n\t\t// Process login logic\n\t\treturn { success: true };\n\t}\n};\n```\n\n### Customized Enhancement:\n\nFor more control over the enhancement behavior, you can provide a callback to `use:enhance`:\n\n```svelte\n<!-- Customized form enhancement -->\n<script>\n\timport { enhance } from '$app/forms';\n\t\n\tlet isLoading = false;\n</script>\n\n<form\n\tmethod=\"POST\"\n\tuse:enhance={() => {\n\t\tisLoading = true;\n\t\t\n\t\treturn async ({ update }) => {\n\t\t\tisLoading = false;\n\t\t\t// Use default behavior\n\t\t\tupdate();\n\t\t};\n\t}}\n>\n\t<!-- form fields -->\n\t<button>\n\t\t{#if isLoading}\n\t\t\tSubmitting...\n\t\t{:else}\n\t\t\tSubmit\n\t\t{/if}\n\t</button>\n</form>\n```\n\nThe `use:enhance` action provides seamless progressive enhancement by:\n- Working without JavaScript (traditional form submission)\n- Enhancing with JavaScript (AJAX submission without page reloads)\n- Handling redirects, validation errors, and success states automatically\n- Resetting forms and updating page state appropriately\n\nThis approach ensures your forms work for all users regardless of their JavaScript settings while providing an improved experience for those with JavaScript enabled.<|im_end|>","judge":{"score":2,"notes":"The answer provides a mostly correct explanation of progressive enhancement with SvelteKit form actions and includes working code examples. However, it has some issues: (1) The question asks about 'form remote function' which is not a standard SvelteKit API - the correct API is 'use:enhance' from '$app/forms', which the answer does use correctly; (2) The answer doesn't cite the precise file locations or API documentation references (e.g., it should reference the SvelteKit docs at kit.svelte.dev); (3) The explanation is accurate but could be more precise about what 'form remote function' refers to - it appears the question may contain a terminology error.
